# KnightTour

## Project Overview
A Java application that includes various concepts of Object-Oriented Programming with two versions
of GUI (Swing and JavaFX). The knight makes L-shaped moves on an eight-by-eight chessboard.

This application includes two modes:
1) Manual mode
prompts the user to attempt a Knightâ€™s Tour by hand and runs until no available outstanding move exists on the chessboard.
2) Automatic mode
implements a heuristic algorithm that achieves a full tour consists of 64 moves.

## Steps
* Import the source code files into a Java IDE (e.g. Eclipse) 
* Choose one of the modes: Manaul or Automatic
* Run the main modules (MainHeuristic.java & MainMenual.java)
* Insert the initial position of the Knight. Click the destination if you are running the Manual mode
* Have fun!
